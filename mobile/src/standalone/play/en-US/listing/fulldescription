Pomodoro app for Android Wear.

Say "OK Google, start working" to start the application. 

It runs on the watch itself, so you don't need your phone to be connected. 

Configuration and phone sync support is coming soon.

Note: There won't be any application in your phone to see. For now, it is only in your watch.
